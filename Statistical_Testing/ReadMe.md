Hypothesis Testing was done using scipy.stats.ttest_ind function with the equal_var parameter set to False. Images from this 
data are included in the imagesHT folder.

AB Testing was done by calculating the pooled estimate and the standard error of the estimate (of 2 proportions)
and then calculating the zscore and pvalue of using the test statistic.
